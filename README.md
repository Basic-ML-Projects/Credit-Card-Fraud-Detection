# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A brief hands-on work through of Kaggle's Credit Card Detection dataset. Since this was my first "formal"(a project that I share to the public), I decided to make things concise and simple. For example, I only use Isolation Forest and Logistic Regression to predict the outliers, but I could have implemented more algorithms such as Local Outlier Factor(LOF), Random Forest, XGBoost, etc. I did not do any feature selection or feature engineering, but this was because the dataset provided was already transformed using Principal Component Analysis(PcA). I also did not use CrossValidation or Stacking, however these will be things I implement in future projects that I would share to the public.
